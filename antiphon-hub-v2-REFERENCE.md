# Antiphon Hub v2 – Reference Only

This folder (`antiphon-hub-v2/`) is the previous standalone Hub project.

- It is kept as a read-only reference for UI, flows, and code patterns.
- All new development happens in the `packages/hub` app inside this monorepo.
- Do not commit new work directly into `antiphon-hub-v2/`.
